News App stage 01: Part of Android Basic Nanodegree Schorlarship with Google/Udacity: Project 06

## Project Overview
The final project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making your own app that connects to the Internet to provide news articles on a topic of your choice.

You are expected to have passed the News App, Stage 1 project prior to beginning this project.

The goal is to add a Settings Screen to the News Feed app you made earlier in Part 1 which will allow users to narrow down the stories displayed in from the feed. The available preference options presented to the user will be left up to you to decide (e.g. publishing time, country, topic category, etc. )

## Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you added a Preference screen that allowed users to select a minimum magnitude size for earthquakes that should be displayed , and to change whether they'd like to see earthquakes ordered by magnitude or time. One of the foundations of Android is that it should "Make me amazing". That often means that each user needs a slightly different experience, tailored to them and their particular preferences. Hence, we provide a way for users to adjust preferences in our app, and remember which preferences they've chosen.

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Implement the Preference Fragment
* Launch a Settings Activity from a menu in the Main Activity
* Use Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to the URL
* Update and display the Preference Summary

Note: As the focus of this program is Java, only projects completed with Java as the source code will be accepted. Projects using Kotlin as the source code will not be accepted.
